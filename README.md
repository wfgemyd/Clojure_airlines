# Clojure Airlines 🛫

This project forms a part of the Symbolic Computation course in the BSc (Hons) Computing program. Presented Clojure program efficiently reads and processes flight data, offering personalized flight plans tailored to your preferences.

## Overview

The program is structured as follows:

- **Data Parsing**: Utilizes clojure.data.csv to parse flight information from the "Flights_ICA1.csv" dataset.

- **Graph Representation**: Constructs a graph where cities are vertices and flights are edges, representing the entire flight network.

- **User Input**: Accepts user preferences including current location, destination, budget, and maximum flight count.

- **Flight Plan Generation**: Employs a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to curate flight plans meeting user's criteria.

- **Sorting and Optimization**: Sorts flight plans by cost and flight count, eliminating duplicates.


## Usage 

1. Ensure that JDK, Clojure and Leiningen are installed on your system. Visit [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads), [Clojure's official website](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) and [Leiningen's website](https://leiningen.org/#install) for installation instructions.

2. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/wfgemyd/Clojure_airlines.git
  ```

3.  Make sure that the required dependencies are connected correctly.

```
lein deps 
lein deps :tree
```

4. Ensure that the dataset "Flights_ICA1.csv" file is in the "src/airlines" directory. Alternatively, you can use your own dataset. Ensure it's in CSV format and contains necessary flight data fields.

5. Run the program using Clojure REPL. 

5. Follow the prompts to provide your current location, destination, budget, and maximum number of flights.

6. The program will display flight plans that meet your criteria, showing the most expensive and cheapest options.

## Example

### Scenario
Finding flights from New York to Los Angeles with a budget of $500 and a maximum of 2 flights.

### Results
- **Plan 1 (Most Expensive)**:

  ```
  Path: New York --> Chicago (200) --> Los Angeles (300)
  Total Cost: 500
  Amount of flights: 2
  ```
- **Plan 2 (Cheapest)**:

  ```
  Path: New York --> Los Angeles (500)
  Total Cost: 500
  Amount of flights: 1
  ```
## Features 

- **Custom Flight Search**: Input your travel details and let our algorithm present you with the best flight options.
  
- **Interactive CLI**: The interactive command-line prompts offer a user-friendly experience for easy navigation.
  
- **Multiple Destinations**: Multiple route options can be explored to reach your desired location.
  
- **Graph representation of flight networks**: The flight connections and cities are presented in a graph data structure for a clear representation of the flight network.
  
- **Customizable and Extensible Code Structure**: Tailor the application to your needs or contribute to its growth!

## Limitations and Future Improvements 

- **Single Data Source**: The program currently supports only one CSV data file as a data source for flight information.
  
- **Error Handling**: The program currently does not handle missing fields or invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent cities, negative budget values) in the dataset gracefully. Ensure that the CSV file has no missing or invalid values.
  
- **Limited Filtering Options**: Currently, our program is designed to output the most and least expensive flight connections.

- **Localization**: Currently, the program only supports datasets and inputs in English. Internationalization features, such as multi-language support, are not yet implemented.
